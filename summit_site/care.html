        <p>It is so wonderful when owning an Alaskan Husky because this is one of the rarest sorts from countries to the world. However, apart from their cuties, you should know how to take care of them carefully. This is a great challenge for those who love pooches. Here is how!</p>
    <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>Because the Alaskan Husky is a highly intelligent breed, he typically responds well to training. Start training your husky as early as possible to head off the development of problem behaviors – if you wait too long to start training your dog could become willful or headstrong. Positive reinforcement training methods are recommended for this breed and it is best to keep your training sessions short and fun so your dog doesn’t get bored.</p>

<h2> How to take Care of a Siberian Husky </h2>
        <img class="floatright" src="images/adorable-animal-canine-1097551.jpg" alt="a girl and her siberian husky">
        <p>The American Kennel Club describes the Siberian husky as "loyal, mischievous and outgoing." Caring for this high energy but friendly canine is a bit more work than the average dog. Expect to give your Siberian husky plenty of exercise, but never let him off the leash. Remember, these working sled dogs were born to run. While he's fine with other dogs, the husky has strong prey instincts, so living with smaller animals -- including felines -- probably isn't a good idea. While a husky is an excellent family dog, he's no watchdog. Friends, strangers, he welcomes one and all. </p>
    <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>Siberian huskies aren't the easiest dogs to train, so they aren't a good choice for those who have never before had a dog. If you do have dog experience, patience and persistence will get you through the husky training experience. Huskies are smart, but they require an owner who can assume an alpha role, so the dog knows that you are the leader in your household pack, not him. Socializing your dog as much as possible and taking him to obedience classes starting in puppyhood makes training easier.</p>
    <h3>Grooming</h3>
        <p>While your husky sports a lot of hair, he's not a terrible shedder. Of course, that doesn't include the semi-annual ritual known as "blowing the coat," when husky hair will overtake your home. Most of the time, brushing him a couple of times a week suffices to get rid of old hair. During shedding season, you may need to use a coat rake to keep up with the hair loss and brush him once or twice daily. Siberian huskies rarely need bathing as they are among the cleanest of canines, and don't have a doggy odor.</p>
    <h3>Health and Nutrition</h3>
        <p>Siberian huskies are a relatively healthy breed, but do suffer from some genetic issues. These primarily concern eye and orthopedic problems, although epilepsy also occurs in the huskies. Eye issues include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Progressive retinal atrophy, which renders the dog blind.</li>
    <li>Cataracts.</li>
    <li>Corneal dystrophy, which generally affects both eyes.</li>
    <li>Glaucoma.</li>

</ul>
