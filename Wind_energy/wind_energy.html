<h4><strong><em>Basics of Wind Energy</em></strong></h4>
<h1>Wind energy</h1>
<p><h3>What is wind energy?</h3>
Wind energy (or wind power) refers to the process of creating electricity using the wind, or air flows that occur naturally in the earth’s atmosphere. Modern wind turbines are used to capture kinetic energy from the wind and generate electricity.</p>

<p><h3>There are <em><strong>three</strong></em> main types of wind energy:</h3></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Utility-scale wind: Wind turbines that range in size from 100 kilowatts to several megawatts, where the electricity is delivered to the power grid and distributed to the end user by electric utilities or power system operators.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Distributed or "<em>small</em>" wind:  Single small wind turbines below 100 kilowatts that are used to directly power a home, farm or small business and are not connected to the grid.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Offshore wind:</strong> Wind turbines that are erected in large bodies of water, usually on the continental shelf. Offshore wind turbines are larger than land-based turbines and can generate more power.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
<p><h3>How wind turbines work</h3></p>	<p>When the wind blows past a wind turbine, its blades capture the wind’s kinetic energy and rotate, turning it into mechanical energy. This rotation turns an internal shaft connected to a gearbox, which increases the speed of rotation by a factor of 100. That spins a generator that produces electricity.</p>
