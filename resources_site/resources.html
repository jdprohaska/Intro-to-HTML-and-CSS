	<p>W3Schools is a web developers site, with tutorials and references on web development languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Python, jQuery, Java, W3.CSS, and Bootstrap, covering most aspects of web programming.

	The site derives its name from the World Wide Web (W3), but is not affiliated with the W3C.

	W3Schools was originally created in 1998 by Refsnes Data, a Norwegian software development and consulting company.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm" target="_blank" alt="tutorials point">Tutorials point</a></p>
	<p>Tutorials Point originated from the idea that there exists a class of readers who respond better to online content and prefer to learn new skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing rooms.

	The journey commenced with a single tutorial on HTML in 2006 and elated by the response it generated, we worked our way to adding fresh tutorials to our repository which now proudly flaunts a wealth of tutorials and allied articles on topics ranging from programming languages to web designing to academics and much more.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html" target="_blank" alt="code academy"> Code academy</a></p>
	<p>odecademy is an education company. But not one in the way you might think. Weâ€™re committed to building the best learning experience inside and out, making Codecademy the best place for our team to learn, teach, and create the online learning experience of the future.</p>
